O\\u2019Neil of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr.\\u00a0of the District of Columbia and Acting Special Agent in Charge Katrina W. Berger of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) made the announcement.Merhay, 47, arrived in the United States on April 25, 2014, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson in the District of Columbia.   He was indicted under seal in the District of Columbia in 2012, and the charges were unsealed today.   Merhay has been in the custody of Moroccan authorities pending extradition since his arrest in Marrakech, Morocco, in August 2013.The indictment charges Merhay with one count of conspiracy to bring undocumented migrants to the United States for profit and 15 counts of unlawfully bringing an undocumented migrant to the United States for profit.   Court documents allege that Merhay operated with a network of smugglers in Africa, the United Arab Emirates, South and Central America, Mexico and elsewhere to coordinate and implement arrangements, including providing fraudulent identity and travel documents, for undocumented migrants to travel through Latin America and ultimately into the United States without authorization.   For up to $15,000, Merhay arranged for individual undocumented migrants to travel from points in Africa to a house or apartment in Dubai, where he provided travel documents, tickets and instructions for meeting other smugglers while on the way to the United States.   Merhay coordinated the migrants\\u2019 air travel to South America, where they would meet with Merhay\\u2019s associates, who would direct or guide them across the various country borders.   The undocumented migrants then met with other smugglers associated with Merhay and were further guided north to Mexico and then into the United States, sometimes by crossing the Rio Grande River by raft.The investigation was conducted under the Extraterritorial Criminal Travel Strike Force (ECT) program, a joint partnership between the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division and ICE-HSI.   The ECT program focuses on human smuggling networks that may present particular national security or public safety risks or present grave humanitarian concerns.   ECT has dedicated investigative, intelligence and prosecutorial resources.   ECT coordinates and receives assistance from other U.S. government agencies and foreign law enforcement authorities.The investigation was conducted by HSI Washington.\\u00a0 This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Jay Bauer of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick Yette of the District of Columbia.\\u00a0 The extradition was handled by Dan E. Stigall of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Office of International Affairs.The Department of Justice and HSI expressed their appreciation for the significant assistance provided by the Moroccan Ministry of Justice.The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.      \\u00a0\",\n          \"  Metropolitan Ambulance & First Aid Corp. (now known as SEZ Metro Corp.), Metro North Ambulance Corp. (now known as SEZ North Corp.) and Big Apple Ambulance Service Inc. (formerly known as United Ambulance) have paid the United States $2.85 million to resolve false claims made to Medicare, the Justice Department announced today. The United States stipulated to the dismissal of the False Claims Act qui tam suit against the companies, including their president, Steve Zakheim.   The United States alleged that the companies and Zakheim used, or caused the use of, falsified records to appeal a Medicare program refund demand. Medicare had demanded the companies return millions of dollars they had been paid for medically unnecessary ambulance trips. Under Medicare rules, the companies could bill for these expensive non-emergency transports only if the patient could not be transported by any other means, such as by car or by wheelchair van. Medicare audited the companies\\u2019 past billings and concluded that the companies had charged Medicare tens of millions of dollars for ambulance trips that did not meet this standard. Medicare demanded a refund and afforded the companies an extensive informal and formal appeals process to prove that their billings were proper.   The government contended that, rather than contesting the refund demand fairly, the companies resorted to fraud when they could not otherwise prove an ambulance was medically needed. According to the suit, in their ensuing appeals, the companies used, and Zakheim caused the use of, hundreds of letters attesting to the need for an ambulance that were forged or otherwise purported to come from some neutral, disinterested health care provider when they in fact did not.   \\\"Those who benefit from Medicare must play by the rules,\\\" said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. \\\"We will diligently protect taxpayer dollars from those who use fraud and deceit to take advantage of federal health care programs.\\\"   \\\"Healthcare providers who seek to defraud the Medicare program by submitting false documents will be vigorously pursued and held accountable for their fraud,\\\" said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch.   This action was originally filed by Larry Kaplan, a former Chief Financial Officer for one of the companies, under the False Claims Act. The qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the Act permit private citizens to file suit on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery. Mr. Kaplan\\u2019s share of the settlement announced today will be $618,450.   The investigation, litigation, and resolution of these allegations resulted from a coordinated effort by the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Division, the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Department of Health and Human Services\\u2019 Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   The suit is United States ex rel. Kaplan v. Metropolitan Ambulance & First-Aid Corp. et al., Civil Action No. 00-3010 (E.D.N.Y.).   This settlement is part of the government\\u2019s emphasis on combating health care fraud. One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover approximately $3 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.\",\n          \"  WASHINGTON \\u2014 The United States has filed a complaint against Louisiana Generating alleging that the company violated the Clean Air Act by operating the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant, a coal-fired power plant in New Roads, La., without also installing and operating modern pollution control equipment after the generating units had undergone major modifications, the Justice Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today.\\u00a0   The complaint alleges that for more than a decade, the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant has operated without the best available emissions-control technology required by the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, contributing to formation of fine particulate matter, smog and acid rain.   The lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA, asks the court to order Louisiana Generating to install and operate appropriate air pollution control technology in order to substantially reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant.\\u00a0 The United States also seeks civil penalties up to the maximum amount authorized by law, as well as actions by the energy provider to mitigate the adverse effects alleged to have been caused by the violations.\\u00a0   Coal-fired power plants collectively produce more pollution than any other industry in the United States.\\u00a0 They account for nearly 70 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions each year and 20 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions.\\u00a0 Emissions from coal-fired power plants have detrimental health effects on asthma sufferers, the elderly and children.\\u00a0 Additionally, these emissions have been linked to forest degradation, waterway damage, reservoir contamination and deterioration of stone and copper in buildings.   To combat these adverse effects, the EPA and the Justice Department are pursuing a national initiative, targeting electric utilities whose coal-fired power plants violate the law.\\u00a0 The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Baton Rouge, La.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2400,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2010-10-12T00:00:00-04:00\",\n          \"2013-12-23T00:00:00-05:00\",\n          \"2013-07-02T00:00:00-04:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"components\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge George L. Piro of the FBI\\u2019s Miami Division and Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General\\u2019s (HHS-OIG) Miami Regional Office made the announcement. Raciel Leon, 42, of Miami, was convicted after a two-week jury trial of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and pay and receive health care bribes and kickbacks. According to evidence presented at trial, between approximately October 2014 and June 2015, Leon was the manager of Mercy Home Care Inc. (Mercy) and a billing employee for D&D&D Home Health Care Inc. (DDD), both of which were home health agencies in Miami-Dade County, Florida.\\u00a0 The evidence showed that Leon and his co-conspirators used the companies to submit false claims to Medicare that were based on services that were not medically necessary, not actually provided and for patients that were procured through the payment of illegal kickbacks to doctors and patient recruiters.\\u00a0 In an attempt to support the false claims, Leon\\u2019s co-conspirators forged prescriptions and other medical records, and Leon submitted claims to Medicare based on the falsified documentation. The evidence introduced at trial further established that between October 2014 and June 2015, Medicare paid approximately $2.5 million for false and fraudulent claims submitted by Mercy and DDD. The FBI and HHS-OIG investigated the case, which was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force under the supervision of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\\u00a0 Fraud Section Trial Attorneys Lisa Miller and Angela Adams are prosecuting the case. The Fraud Section leads the Medicare Fraud Strike Force.\\u00a0 Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, now operating in nine cities across the country, has charged nearly 3,000 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for more than $11 billion. \\u00a0In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.\",\n          \"  Pharmaceutical manufacturer Abbott Laboratories Inc. was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G. Wilson of the Western District of Virginia in connection with its guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the Justice Department announced today.   Abbott, which was ordered to pay a criminal fine in the amount of $500 million, plus a forfeiture of $198.5 million, and $1.5 million to the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, will also be subject to a five-year term of probation.   \\u00a0   In May 2012, Abbott pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor for misbranding Depakote in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).   Abbott\\u2019s criminal plea related to the misbranding of Depakote by promoting the drug to control behavioral disturbances in dementia patients and to treat schizophrenia when neither of these uses was approved by the FDA.   Under the provisions of the FDCA, a company is required to specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to FDA.   Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for \\u201coff-label\\u201d uses     \\u2013 unless the company applies to the FDA for approval of the additional use.   In an agreed statement of facts, Abbott admitted that from January 1998 to December 2006 it marketed Depakote off-label to treat behavioral disturbances in dementia patients, and from January 2002 to December 2006, Abbott marketed Depakote off-label to treat schizophrenia.   \\u00a0   Under the terms of the plea agreement, Abbott agreed to pay the second-largest criminal fine for a single drug, executed a fulsome statement of facts (with exhibits) revealing the extent of its unlawful conduct, admitted that it engaged in misleading statements, and submitted to a five-year term of probation.   Under the terms of its probation, on an annual basis, Abbott\\u2019s CEO and board of directors will need to personally certify that the company is complying with the law.   \\u00a0   Abbott\\u2019s guilty plea was part of a global resolution involving its illegal promotional activity.   Abbott also entered into a civil settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve claims that its unlawful marketing and illegal remuneration practices caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs.   The parallel civil settlement covered a broader range of conduct by Abbott.   The settlement resolved allegations that in addition to off-label marketing for dementia and schizophrenia, Abbott also marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,   post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism.      In addition to the criminal and civil resolutions, Abbott also agreed to enter into an expansive 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG) that requires enhanced accountability, increased transparency, and wide-ranging monitoring activities conducted by both internal and independent external reviewers.      \\u00a0   \\u201cToday\\u2019s sentencing confirms that the resolution we reached with Abbott in May is the right result. And it emphasizes the importance of the U.S. government\\u2019s coordinated efforts to combat health care fraud.   We expect companies to make honest, lawful claims about the drugs they sell, we will be vigorous in our enforcement efforts when they break the law, and the courts will hold them accountable.\\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Division.  \\u00a0   \\u201cAbbott unlawfully targeted a vulnerable population, the elderly, through its off-label promotion.   The court\\u2019s sentence makes clear that those who engage in such conduct will be prosecuted and held accountable,\\u201d said Timothy Heaphy, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia.      This case was handled by the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Division.   The investigation was conducted by     the Virginia Attorney General\\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation; the FDA - Office of Criminal Investigation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General; the West Virginia State Police; the Office of Personnel Management - Office of Inspector General; the Department of Veterans\\u2019 Affairs Office of Inspector General; the Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and TRICARE Program Integrity.\",\n          \"  WASHINGTON \\u2013 Anthony L. Dinunzio, 53, of East Boston, Mass., the acting leader of the New England La Cosa Nostra (NELCN) crime family, pleaded guilty today for his role in a conspiracy to extort protection payments from adult entertainment businesses in Rhode Island, according to a signed plea agreement filed today in U.S. District Court in Providence, R.I.   The plea agreement was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division; Peter F. Neronha, U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island; Richard Deslauriers, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\\u2019s Boston Field Office; Colonel Steven G.

Pare.   \\u201cToday, Anthony Dinunzio admitted to serving as a leader of the New England La Cosa Nostra, a criminal organization that, while under his control, extorted business owners throughout Rhode Island,\\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.\\u00a0 \\u201cDinunzio is the eighth member of the NELCN to plead guilty for his role in the alleged mafia conspiracy that harmed its community for two decades, and this plea is a crucial step in the Justice Department\\u2019s fight to dismantle the NELCN.\\u201d   \\u201cProsecutorial offices, when they are at their best, build cases.\\u00a0 And not just any cases, but impactful cases.\\u00a0 This case is one of those cases,\\u201d said U.S. Attorney Neronha.\\u00a0 \\u201cThrough their painstaking hard work, the prosecutors, agents and detectives have decimated organized crime in Rhode Island and, with this plea today, have removed its leader in Boston.\\u201d   \\u201cMr. Dinunzio\\u2019s guilty plea based on the evidence gathered by the FBI and our law enforcement partners shows undeniably we have shattered Omerta, the New England LCN\\u2019s code of silence,\\u201d said Special Agent in Charge DesLauriers.\\u00a0 \\u201cOur persistent, methodical, and unyielding investigation of those who are part of the LCN and other new national and transnational organized crime groups emerging from every corner of the globe will not stop.\\u201d   Dinunzio pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge William E. Smith in the District of Rhode Island to one count of conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise (RICO).\\u00a0 At sentencing, scheduled for Nov. 14, 2012, Dinunzio faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.   According to the signed plea agreement, Dinunzio was a member and leader of the NELCN from at least 2002, as charged in a superseding indictment returned on April 24, 2012.\\u00a0 Dinunzio admitted committing multiple acts of extortion and knowingly assisted in the charged criminal racketeering conspiracy through the oversight and receipt of monthly protection payments, paid in cash by the owners and operators of certain adult entertainment businesses in Rhode Island.\\u00a0 Dinunzio also admitted to obstructing or impeding the administration of justice by, among other methods, attempting to influence, delay or prevent witness testimony related to the investigation and prosecution of NELCN members.   The superseding indictment alleges that Dinunzio participated with other alleged members and associates of NELCN in a racketeering conspiracy in which monthly cash payments for protection of $2,000 to $6,000 were demanded of the owners and operators of several adult entertainment businesses in Rhode Island.   To date, seven leaders, underbosses, members or associates of the NELCN have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to federal prison for their involvement in the alleged racketeering and extortion conspiracy to extort protection payments from adult entertainment businesses and individuals in Rhode Island during the past two decades. Admitted NELCN crime boss Luigi \\u201cLouie\\u201d Manocchio is serving a sentence of 66 months in prison.\\u00a0 Edward \\u201cEddy\\u201d Lato, an admitted capo, is serving a sentence of 108 months in prison.\\u00a0 Alfred \\u201cChippy\\u201d Scivola, an admitted NELCN member, is serving a sentence of 46 months in prison. Admitted NELCN associates Richard Bonifiglia, 58, and Albino \\u201cAlbie\\u201d Folcarelli, 54, are both serving sentences of 84 months in prison. Raymond \\u201cScarface\\u201d Jenkins is serving a sentence of 37 months in prison.\\u00a0 And Thomas Iafrate is serving a sentence of 30 months in prison.   A ninth defendant, Theodore Cardillo, 69, has entered a plea of not guilty to three counts each of RICO conspiracy and extortion conspiracy and is awaiting trial.   An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government\\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney William J. Ferland of the District of Rhode Island and Trial Attorney Sam Nazzaro of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section.\\u00a0 The matter was investigated by the FBI, the Rhode Island State Police and the Providence Police Department.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 95,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-04-23T00:00:00-04:00\",\n          \"2017-12-12T00:00:00-05:00\",\n          \"2016-06-08T00:00:00-04:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"components\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"contents_without_stop_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"administrator Miami - area home health agency convicted today role $ 2.5 million Medicare fraud scheme .

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge George L. Piro of the FBI\\u2019s Miami Division and Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General\\u2019s (HHS-OIG) Miami Regional Office made the announcement. Raciel Leon, 42, of Miami, was convicted after a two-week jury trial of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and pay and receive health care bribes and kickbacks. According to evidence presented at trial, between approximately October 2014 and June 2015, Leon was the manager of Mercy Home Care Inc. (Mercy) and a billing employee for D&D&D Home Health Care Inc. (DDD), both of which were home health agencies in Miami-Dade County, Florida.\\u00a0 The evidence showed that Leon and his co-conspirators used the companies to submit false claims to Medicare that were based on services that were not medically necessary, not actually provided and for patients that were procured through the payment of illegal kickbacks to doctors and patient recruiters.\\u00a0 In an attempt to support the false claims, Leon\\u2019s co-conspirators forged prescriptions and other medical records, and Leon submitted claims to Medicare based on the falsified documentation. The evidence introduced at trial further established that between October 2014 and June 2015, Medicare paid approximately $2.5 million for false and fraudulent claims submitted by Mercy and DDD. The FBI and HHS-OIG investigated the case, which was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force under the supervision of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\\u00a0 Fraud Section Trial Attorneys Lisa Miller and Angela Adams are prosecuting the case. The Fraud Section leads the Medicare Fraud Strike Force.\\u00a0 Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, now operating in nine cities across the country, has charged nearly 3,000 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for more than $11 billion. \\u00a0In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.\",\n          \"  Pharmaceutical manufacturer Abbott Laboratories Inc. was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G. Wilson of the Western District of Virginia in connection with its guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the Justice Department announced today.   Abbott, which was ordered to pay a criminal fine in the amount of $500 million, plus a forfeiture of $198.5 million, and $1.5 million to the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, will also be subject to a five-year term of probation.   \\u00a0   In May 2012, Abbott pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor for misbranding Depakote in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).   Abbott\\u2019s criminal plea related to the misbranding of Depakote by promoting the drug to control behavioral disturbances in dementia patients and to treat schizophrenia when neither of these uses was approved by the FDA.   Under the provisions of the FDCA, a company is required to specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to FDA.   Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for \\u201coff-label\\u201d uses     \\u2013 unless the company applies to the FDA for approval of the additional use.   In an agreed statement of facts, Abbott admitted that from January 1998 to December 2006 it marketed Depakote off-label to treat behavioral disturbances in dementia patients, and from January 2002 to December 2006, Abbott marketed Depakote off-label to treat schizophrenia.   \\u00a0   Under the terms of the plea agreement, Abbott agreed to pay the second-largest criminal fine for a single drug, executed a fulsome statement of facts (with exhibits) revealing the extent of its unlawful conduct, admitted that it engaged in misleading statements, and submitted to a five-year term of probation.   Under the terms of its probation, on an annual basis, Abbott\\u2019s CEO and board of directors will need to personally certify that the company is complying with the law.   \\u00a0   Abbott\\u2019s guilty plea was part of a global resolution involving its illegal promotional activity.   Abbott also entered into a civil settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve claims that its unlawful marketing and illegal remuneration practices caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs.   The parallel civil settlement covered a broader range of conduct by Abbott.   The settlement resolved allegations that in addition to off-label marketing for dementia and schizophrenia, Abbott also marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,   post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism.      In addition to the criminal and civil resolutions, Abbott also agreed to enter into an expansive 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG) that requires enhanced accountability, increased transparency, and wide-ranging monitoring activities conducted by both internal and independent external reviewers.      \\u00a0   \\u201cToday\\u2019s sentencing confirms that the resolution we reached with Abbott in May is the right result. And it emphasizes the importance of the U.S. government\\u2019s coordinated efforts to combat health care fraud.   We expect companies to make honest, lawful claims about the drugs they sell, we will be vigorous in our enforcement efforts when they break the law, and the courts will hold them accountable.\\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Division.  \\u00a0   \\u201cAbbott unlawfully targeted a vulnerable population, the elderly, through its off-label promotion.   The court\\u2019s sentence makes clear that those who engage in such conduct will be prosecuted and held accountable,\\u201d said Timothy Heaphy, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia.      This case was handled by the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Division.   The investigation was conducted by     the Virginia Attorney General\\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation; the FDA - Office of Criminal Investigation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General; the West Virginia State Police; the Office of Personnel Management - Office of Inspector General; the Department of Veterans\\u2019 Affairs Office of Inspector General; the Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and TRICARE Program Integrity.\",\n          \"  WASHINGTON \\u2013 Anthony L. Dinunzio, 53, of East Boston, Mass., the acting leader of the New England La Cosa Nostra (NELCN) crime family, pleaded guilty today for his role in a conspiracy to extort protection payments from adult entertainment businesses in Rhode Island, according to a signed plea agreement filed today in U.S. District Court in Providence, R.I.   The plea agreement was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division; Peter F. Neronha, U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island; Richard Deslauriers, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\\u2019s Boston Field Office; Colonel Steven G.

Pare.   \\u201cToday, Anthony Dinunzio admitted to serving as a leader of the New England La Cosa Nostra, a criminal organization that, while under his control, extorted business owners throughout Rhode Island,\\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.\\u00a0 \\u201cDinunzio is the eighth member of the NELCN to plead guilty for his role in the alleged mafia conspiracy that harmed its community for two decades, and this plea is a crucial step in the Justice Department\\u2019s fight to dismantle the NELCN.\\u201d   \\u201cProsecutorial offices, when they are at their best, build cases.\\u00a0 And not just any cases, but impactful cases.\\u00a0 This case is one of those cases,\\u201d said U.S. Attorney Neronha.\\u00a0 \\u201cThrough their painstaking hard work, the prosecutors, agents and detectives have decimated organized crime in Rhode Island and, with this plea today, have removed its leader in Boston.\\u201d   \\u201cMr. Dinunzio\\u2019s guilty plea based on the evidence gathered by the FBI and our law enforcement partners shows undeniably we have shattered Omerta, the New England LCN\\u2019s code of silence,\\u201d said Special Agent in Charge DesLauriers.\\u00a0 \\u201cOur persistent, methodical, and unyielding investigation of those who are part of the LCN and other new national and transnational organized crime groups emerging from every corner of the globe will not stop.\\u201d   Dinunzio pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge William E. Smith in the District of Rhode Island to one count of conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise (RICO).\\u00a0 At sentencing, scheduled for Nov. 14, 2012, Dinunzio faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.   According to the signed plea agreement, Dinunzio was a member and leader of the NELCN from at least 2002, as charged in a superseding indictment returned on April 24, 2012.\\u00a0 Dinunzio admitted committing multiple acts of extortion and knowingly assisted in the charged criminal racketeering conspiracy through the oversight and receipt of monthly protection payments, paid in cash by the owners and operators of certain adult entertainment businesses in Rhode Island.\\u00a0 Dinunzio also admitted to obstructing or impeding the administration of justice by, among other methods, attempting to influence, delay or prevent witness testimony related to the investigation and prosecution of NELCN members.   The superseding indictment alleges that Dinunzio participated with other alleged members and associates of NELCN in a racketeering conspiracy in which monthly cash payments for protection of $2,000 to $6,000 were demanded of the owners and operators of several adult entertainment businesses in Rhode Island.   To date, seven leaders, underbosses, members or associates of the NELCN have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to federal prison for their involvement in the alleged racketeering and extortion conspiracy to extort protection payments from adult entertainment businesses and individuals in Rhode Island during the past two decades. Admitted NELCN crime boss Luigi \\u201cLouie\\u201d Manocchio is serving a sentence of 66 months in prison.\\u00a0 Edward \\u201cEddy\\u201d Lato, an admitted capo, is serving a sentence of 108 months in prison.\\u00a0 Alfred \\u201cChippy\\u201d Scivola, an admitted NELCN member, is serving a sentence of 46 months in prison. Admitted NELCN associates Richard Bonifiglia, 58, and Albino \\u201cAlbie\\u201d Folcarelli, 54, are both serving sentences of 84 months in prison. Raymond \\u201cScarface\\u201d Jenkins is serving a sentence of 37 months in prison.\\u00a0 And Thomas Iafrate is serving a sentence of 30 months in prison.   A ninth defendant, Theodore Cardillo, 69, has entered a plea of not guilty to three counts each of RICO conspiracy and extortion conspiracy and is awaiting trial.   An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government\\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney William J. Ferland of the District of Rhode Island and Trial Attorney Sam Nazzaro of the Criminal Division\\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section.\\u00a0 The matter was investigated by the FBI, the Rhode Island State Police and the Providence Police Department.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 95,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-04-23T00:00:00-04:00\",\n          \"2017-12-12T00:00:00-05:00\",\n          \"2016-06-08T00:00:00-04:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"components\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"contents_without_stop_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"administrator Miami - area home health agency convicted today role $ 2.5 million Medicare fraud scheme .
